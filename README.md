## What is let and var in Swift and Objective C?
Swift: The `let` keyword is used to declare a constant and the `var` keyword is used to declare a variable. Variables created with these either references, pointers or values. Difference between them is that when you create a variable using `let` it will become constant upon declaration which can not modify or reassign later. In contrast, a varible with `var` can be assigned right away or later or noty at all. In swift, you have to be very explicit about what you are declaring. 

Objective C: In Objective C everything is `dynamic` and can be `nil`. Also, `nil` can receive messages without breaking anything i.e. throwing an exception.
